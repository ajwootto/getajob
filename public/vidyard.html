				Hey Vidyard,<br/><br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited your house-warming party while working at the Communitech Apps Factory last October, you had kegs of Waterloo Dark. This is a phenomenon I have never seen before at a kegger. That’s when I knew your company was on another level.<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously though, I’d love to work for you guys. I saw a presentation about video marketing given by one of your employees (I think) at Techtoberfest and found it extremely interesting, especially all the things that RIM did wrong with YouTube. This is an idea that I would love to work on, and I believe I have the necessary experience.<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several months of experience working with Ruby on Rails to create two web-based applications, one of which had some basic RSpec tests. I’ve scripted with Python before, doing data parsing work. I made a PhoneGap app for the iPad using HTML5, jQuery, and Backbone.js, which I was offered to continue working on in a freelance setting by the client who commissioned it, after my work term ended. I’ve designed and implemented a database schema in SQL, I made an API in PHP to communicate with an Android app, and we used Github for version control at Communitech. Basically, I hit every bullet on your little listy thing.<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s all on my resume though. I have a personal website that has more detail on everything, check it out. My non-technical side is interested in things like Team Fortress 2 (mainly soldier, sometimes spy), Reddit (never at work though!), video-making and generally being awesome. I hope you will allow me to continue being awesome at Vidyard.<br/><br/>
				Thanks,<br/>
				Adam
